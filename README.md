## Project Goal

- To build a master class hotel website  showing all the excellent features of the hotel. Making it look as close to the design as possible.

  After the development, users should be able to

  1. View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

  2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

- Upload the website to free  theme-selling directories

- Get as many downloads as possible



## Getting Started

The Frontend team has been sectioned into groups, with each group expected to work on a design. The group leader for group 2 is @Gordie. Check the guide on [GitHub projects]().  Click [here](https://github.com/hng-teamfury/hng/blob/master/README.md#how-to-git-bash) for instructions on how to setup before working on this project. 

## The Design

 Five designs were sent to the frontend team by the UI/UX designers. These designs were graded by the design team and reviewed by @KingDavid before being sent to the frontend team. Each design was allocated to one group. The design for group 2 can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/CypYHHWsaT7rOErPDWMhPx/TheCosmopoiltanHotel?node-id=0%3A1). It was created by @DmaskedOne.

## Workflow from Figma to Coding

- #### The objectives guiding the group

  - consistency with the design templates
  - mobile readiness (responsiveness)
  - cross browser consistency
  - ease of customizability
  - use of high assets

- #### **Collaboration and Sharing of Tasks**

  There are 4 pages on the design. To make the workflow easy, the project was divided into smaller tasks to be collaboratively worked on by the members making us finish on time.

  The tasks were divided as follows:

  ● Project Setup

  ● Header section

  ● Footer section

  ● Front Page

  ● Rooms and Pricing Page

  ● Facilities Page

  ● Contact Page

  After completion of the tasks, a task force was selected to implement responsiveness to the site. The pull requests were made to the Official [Team-Fury Group 2 branch](https://github.com/hng-teamfury-org/frontend/tree/Group2) and merges was done by the Group Lead  @Gordie who also deployed the site to [Netlify](https://the-cosmopolitan-hotel.netlify.app). All the pages were reviewed by team mates as each task was posted on Github.

  #### Workflow

  The group members took their time to analyze and study the design requirements on the [Figma board](https://www.figma.com/file/CypYHHWsaT7rOErPDWMhPx/TheCosmopoiltanHotel?node-id=0%3A1[). With the help of the designer,  they were able too get the design assets. which were then compressed and posted on google drive for easy access to all the members. The project was then initialized on the group's HNG organization repository branch on [Github](https://github.com/hng-teamfury-org/frontend/tree/Group2). Every member then forks the repo and clone it to their local devices to start working on their various tasks. For easier reusability and code compatibility, Bootstrap was agreed on by the members and guidelines to styles in CSS made.

  The HTML was first used to structure the page to help the group focus on creating well-structured content, taking into consideration mobile first approach development. Then styling to the appropriate pages was done, reiterating the styling process to perfectly replicate the design.

  Once a subgroup is done with their task they push to github then make PR which is merged by the team git manager. After this every other team will then update the branch to avoid conflict. Finally the code is cleaned up and formatted appropriately

The development technologies used on the site are HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap framework used along with JQuery library.
